  ## Description
  
This app allows you to build and manage your organization chart for a company. You can add departments, roles, and employees, as well as move employees between roles and delete elements that are no longer needed, all in the console.
  ## Installation
  
You will need to install node.js, inquirer, console.table, and mysql to run this program. You'll also need a database program like mySql Workbench.
  
  ## Usage
  
As currently written, you'll need to use the 'orgChartSeeds.sql' file to create a database in your database program. I recommend using everything above like 35 and then using the program to populate your database, but there are some INSERT lines there to get you started as well if you need them. Once you've created a database, you'll need to run node server.js from the root folder in the console.. You'll be prompted to begin from there.
